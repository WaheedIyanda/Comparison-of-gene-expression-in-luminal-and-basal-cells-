Comparison of gene expression in luminal and basal cells harvested from the mammary glands of virgin, 18.5 day pregnant and 2 day lactating mice (2 mice per stage).
Organism	Mus musculus
Experiment type	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary	To identify genes specifically expressed in lactating mammary glands, the gene expression profiles of luminal and basal cells from different developmental stages were compared.
